# Habitat

This game is my entry for IVGJ2016, it has been created in two weeks, in my free time. 
It classified 3rd place in this competition.

## Intro ##
> A bunch of scientists are partecipating to a science showdown with their entry: a little synthetic world, populated by little creatures.
You are one of them. Your objective is to grow by eating your synthetic food to increase your mass.
But you also have to survive in this dangerous artificially-created world: other organisms will try to eat you!
Move your organism with W, A, S, D and rotate the camera with right mouse button!
Space to jump and Enter to skip dialogues (I suggest you to read them or my friend Guglielmo will feel extremely sad)!


## Interesting features ##
It includes various interesting features like:

 - procedural world generation
 - random populating of generated chunks
 - narration system
